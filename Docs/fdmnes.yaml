# To include a FDMNES card which only consists of a key,                              #
#   use the word "include" as the value.                                              #

# To include a FDMNES card which consists of both a key and a value,                  #
#   make the value the same as what would appear in the FDMNES input file.            #
#   EXCEPTIONS:                                                                       #
#       Atom_conf: use the format of {"Z": orbital description}                       #
#           This means do NOT include the number of sites, or their ids.              #
#       Atom: use a dictionary as input                                               #

# To not include a FDMNES card, please use None as the value. It is convenient        #
#   to leave all possible cards in the file so that they remain for future context.   #

# NOTE: Convolution is performed within FANTASTX, using the same procedure as FDMNES. #
#       Define the convolution params inside the main yaml file.                      #
