"""
This module contains the following classes - 

xanes_of_model
Calculate XANES spectra, either the raw spectra or the difference spectra (essential for XTA analysis, and
useful for raw XANES analysis as well).

pdf_of_model
Calculates the PDF and fit it to the experimental pdf. Uses the residual to calculate objective function.

gb_ingrained
Simulates STEM image of a grain boundary structure with "Ingrained" package

xrd_of_model
Calculates the powder diffraction pattern (neutron or X-ray) of a crystal structure and calculate the similarity descriptor against experimental data.

stm_of_model
Simulates STM image of a surface structure with "Ingrained" package
